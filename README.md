Doubt Remedy
Doubt Remedy is a Full Stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application that provides a platform for users to engage in a thriving knowledge-sharing community. The application includes robust JWT-based email and password authentication to ensure secure user access and data privacy.

Features
JWT-based Authentication: Users can securely register and log in using their email and password. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used to manage user authentication, enhancing security and maintaining user sessions.

Points-Based System: Upon registration, users are allocated points that they can utilize to post insightful questions on diverse subjects. This incentivizes knowledge sharing and active participation within the community.

Quality Incentives: To promote high-quality responses, questions are limited to two answers. Contributors are rewarded with half of the points assigned to the question, encouraging meaningful user engagement.

Scalable Data Management: MongoDB is used for efficient and scalable data management. User data, questions, and answers are stored securely in the database, ensuring seamless retrieval and storage.

Interactive User Interfaces: React is leveraged to create interactive and user-friendly interfaces. This enhances the overall user experience and encourages active engagement on the platform.

Asynchronous Operations: Node.js is used for asynchronous programming, ensuring efficient and non-blocking operations, which leads to a responsive application.

MVC Architecture: The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, resulting in a highly organized and maintainable codebase. This clear separation of components streamlines development and simplifies debugging.
